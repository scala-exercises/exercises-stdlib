  /** A Range is an ordered sequence of integers that are equally spaced apart. For example, "1, 2, 3" is a range, as is "5, 8, 11, 14". To create a range in Scala, use the predefined methods `to` and `by`. `1 to 3` generates `Range(1, 2, 3)` and `5 to 14 by 3` generates `Range(5, 8, 11, 14)`.
    *
    * If you want to create a range that is exclusive of its upper limit, then use the convenience method `until` instead of `to`: `1 until 3` generates `Range(1, 2)`.
    *
    * Ranges are represented in constant space, because they can be defined by just three numbers: their start, their end, and the stepping value. Because of this representation, most operations on ranges are extremely fast.

    * A range's upper bound is not inclusive:
