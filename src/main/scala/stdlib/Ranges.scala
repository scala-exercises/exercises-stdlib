   * A Range is an ordered sequence of integers that are equally spaced apart. For example, "1, 2, 3" is a range, as is "5, 8, 11, 14". To create a range in Scala, use the predefined methods `to`, `until`, and `by`. `1 to 3` generates "1, 2, 3" and `5 to 14 by 3` generates "5, 8, 11, 14".
   *
   * If you want to create a range that is exclusive of its upper limit, then use `until` instead of `to`: `1 until 3` generates "1, 2".
   *
   * Note that `Range(a, b, c)` is the same as `a until b by c`
   *
   * Ranges are represented in constant space, because they can be defined by just three numbers: their start, their end, and the stepping value. Because of this representation, most operations on ranges are extremely fast.
   *
   * A range's upper bound is not inclusive:
