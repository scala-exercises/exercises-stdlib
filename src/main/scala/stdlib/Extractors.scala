  /** In Scala, patterns can be defined independently of case classes. To this end, a method named `unapply` is defined to yield a so-called extractor.
   *
   * For instance, the following code defines an extractor object `Twice`.
   *
   * {{{
   * object Twice {
   * def apply(x: Int): Int = x * 2
   * def unapply(z: Int): Option[Int] = if (z%2 == 0) Some(z/2) else None
   * }
   *
   * object TwiceTest extends Application {
   * val x = Twice(21)
   * x match { case Twice(n) => Console.println(n) } // prints 21
   * }
   * }}}
   *
   * There are two syntactic conventions at work here:
   *
   *  - The pattern `case Twice(n)` will cause an invocation of `Twice.unapply`, which is used to match even number; the return value of the `unapply` signals whether the argument has matched or not, and any sub-values that can be used for further matching. Here, the sub-value is `z/2`
   *  - The `apply` method is not necessary for pattern matching. It is only used to mimick a constructor. `val x = Twice(21)` expands to `val x = Twice.apply(21)`.
   *
   * The code in the preceding example would be expanded as follows:
   *
   * {{{
   * object TwiceTest extends Application {
   * val x = Twice.apply(21)
   * Twice.unapply(x) match { case Some(n) => Console.println(n) } // prints 21
   * }
   * }}}
   * The return type of an `unapply` should be chosen as follows:
   *
   *  - If it is just a test, return a `Boolean`. For instance `case even()`
   *  - If it returns a single sub-value of type `T`, return a `Option[T]`
   *  - If you want to return several sub-values `T1,...,Tn`, group them in an optional tuple `Option[(T1,...,Tn)]`.
   *
   * Sometimes, the number of sub-values is fixed and we would like to return a sequence. For this reason, you can also define patterns through `unapplySeq`. The last sub-value type `Tn` has to be `Seq[S]`. This mechanism is used for instance in pattern `case List(x1, ..., xn)`.
   *
   * When you create a case class, it automatically can be used with pattern matching since it has an extractor:
